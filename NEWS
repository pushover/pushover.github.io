Version 0.0.4 January 2013

  using the same account

  still gets marked as solved, but with a different marker

  Spanish and Italian and incomplete translations for French and Russian)
- 3 new music pieces (only one theme music and a title music is now missing)

- expect for a proper level solution that dominos don't lean against a step
  this makes level 64 harder, enforced level 64 to play again by removing a
  useless ladder
- pushover can now quit using the window close button on the window header
- speed-up the fade-in animation when a level is started
- new type of domino: counter blocker, but with no levels using it, yet

  the dominos
